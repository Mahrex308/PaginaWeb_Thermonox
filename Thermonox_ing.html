          <h2 class="titulos">About ThermoNox®<span class="point">.</span></h2>

          <p class="txt">
            The ThermoNox® heat treatment for completely non-toxic disinsection was developed in 1994, with the practical application of heat technology being a fundamental pillar. From the beginning of the development of ThermoNox®, the close cooperation with the German professional mutual for food and catering "Berufsgenossenschaft Nahrungsmittel und Gaststätten" as well as with a leading insurance company was decisive. The safety and high degree of maturity of the ThermoNox® system have always been top priority.
          </p>
          <p class="txt">
            In 1997, the limited company ThermoNox® GmbH was founded, which today is represented by the managing directors Hans and Martin Hofmeir. Since then, the development, sale and production of heat treatments have been closely linked to guarantee maximum efficiency in any situation. Although the system has been tested and has proven to be totally effective, this will always depend on the degree of customer involvement.
          </p>
          <p class="txt">
            We work with very modern and environmentally friendly technology and strive to maintain the most modern technological standard. In addition, we especially value direct contact with the client in order to adapt our services perfectly to their practical needs and to meet the expectations of the clients as best as possible.

          <p class="txt">
            The worldwide growing demand for ThermoNox® shows us that we are not on the wrong track.

          <h2 class="titulos">Functioning<span class="punto">.</span></h2>

          <p class="txt">The ThermoNox® system is based on the principle that food pests such as moths, flour beetles, as well as household pests such as woodworms, bedbugs, mites, clothes moths including their stages of development and eggs are exterminated from safely at a temperature of about 50 °C by protein coagulation.</p>

          <p class="txt texto_mid">FOR AN EFFECTIVE DISINFECTION, YOU MUST ALWAYS COMPLY WITH <span class="point">TWO BASIC REQUIREMENTS.</span></p>

          <p class="txt">On the one hand, the pest eradication temperature must reach 50 °C – 60 °C and remain constant for long enough, even in corners, holes and also inside machinery. On the other hand, the indicated temperature must not be exceeded in any case, otherwise the implementation of the system would not be suitable due to the damage that excess heat could cause.
          </p>

          <p class="txt texto_mid">THE <span class="point">THERMONOX®</span>SYSTEM IS CLEARLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER HEAT EXTERMINATION SYSTEMS BY SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IN AN <span class="point">EASY AND EFFECTIVE WAY:</span></p>

          <p class="txt">Electric heaters in rooms with danger of dust explosion: Our ThermoNox® disinfection heaters can be introduced directly into the buildings to be disinfected, including also rooms with danger of dust explosion since the maximum temperature is limited inside the ThermoNox heaters. ®. Our system is flexible and adapts to any building or room.</p>

          <p class="txt">Progressive and slow heating: Through the slow heating of the air, a more profitable energy use is achieved and possible dilation damage caused by heat is thus avoided. Air circulation: The heating of the air in the room is achieved through the circulation of air inside the building. The powerful fans incorporated in the heaters eliminate cold air currents and thus guarantee optimal heat distribution. All gaps are reached as heat retention is achieved over a long distance through air circulation, even behind heavy installations and hard-to-reach cracks.
          </p>

          <p class="txt">Thermal regulation: The temperature is controlled directly thanks to 3 thermostats built into each ThermoNox® heater that automatically turn off the heaters when the room temperature is higher than 50 ° C and turn them back on when it is lower. This on and off system is also known as timed. Through this exact temperature control, damage that could be caused by heat is avoided and even highly sensitive electronic equipment and modern electrical installations can be disinfected. Room air: Unlike other thermal systems, which heat cold outside air and blow it into the building (“pipe method”), the ThermoNox® system only heats room air in a closed system.
          </p>

          <p class="txt texto_mid">ONLY WITH <span class="point">THERMONOX®</span> IS A TOTAL ERADICATION OF PESTS GUARANTEED AND AT THE SAME TIME THE GREATEST PROTECTION AGAINST POSSIBLE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HEAT</p>
